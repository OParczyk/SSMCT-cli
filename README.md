# Self Similarity Creation Tool CLI-version

This tool aspires to be an easily expandable way of creating (self-)similarity matrices for both visualization or further processing.

This tool is heavily WIP - in fact this marks the start of a rewrite in rust in an attempt to learn the language. This document will be updated reflecting the progress and my certainty in both stability and security of this tool.

The first step will be to evaluate the intended flow of the program, which will be done in a separate markdown document.
